Microsoft Data Science Professional Project

This is the final capstone project part of the Microsoft Professional Program Certificate in Data Science, and my first ever project
in Data Science.

The Adventure Works Cycles company has collected a large volume of data about their existing customers, including 
demographic features and information about purchases they have made. The company is particularly interested in analyzing 
customer data to determine any apparent relationships between demographic features known about the customers and the likelihood 
of a customer purchasing a bike. Additionally, the analysis should endeavor to determine whether a customer's average monthly spend 
with the company can be predicted from known customer characteristics.
